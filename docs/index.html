    <h1>VSCodeTalk Final Project Report</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    Software developers who are blind or visually impaired find it difficult to use productivity-enhancing IDEs
    like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.  CodeTalk is a Visual Studio extension that was previously released 
    to help fix address this problem by providing accessibility improvements while writing and debugging source code.
    The core challenge is that these development environments have highly-complex UI that present large volumes of 
    related content that is often dynamically updated to convey state.  The source code content is structurally interrelated 
    creating significant impediments to efficient navigation.  Dynamic updates can either show continuously updated 
    application state or provide context that a user-initiated action is required.<p />

    VSCodeTalk offers a set of features that address the following categories of usage scenarios i) glanceability, ii) navigability,
    and iii) real-time alertability.  Glanceability is the ability to quickly look at a source code file and ascertain 
    information about the overall code structure.  Navigability is the ability to quickly move around the code to 
    the desired code segment.  Real-time alertability is the ability to receive notifications about the application state
    at the desired time.  The following VSCodeTalk features help improve these use-cases.<p />

    <ul>
        <li><b>Glanceability</b> Function List, Current Context</li>
        <li><b>Navigability</b> Function List, Current Context, Go to Parent</li>
        <li><b>Real-time alertability</b> TalkPoints Debugging Information, Syntax Error Information</li>
    </ul>

    Please watch the following video for additional information about VSCodeTalk, including a demo of some of the 
    most useful features.<p />

    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    The VSCodeTalk project was inspired by the CodeTalk project that is documented at 
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codetalk/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codetalk/</a>.  
    That project includes a Visual Studio extension that implements many of the ideas discussed in the accompanying research paper
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/04/CodeTalkCHI2018CameraReady.pdf">
        https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/04/CodeTalkCHI2018CameraReady.pdf</a>.<p />

    The issues people with visual impairments encounter when using software development environments
    are of interest to tools providers.  The Visual Studio Code team has embraced several concepts similar 
    to VSCodeTalk features that make the default product more accessible.  One example is the Code
    Outline feature that overlaps with the Function List or Code Summary features in many regards.
    Another example is the debugger which has built in voice notifications for several
    breakpoint events, such as speaking the words 'stopped' or 'continue.' <p />
