    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    Software developers who are blind or visually impaired find it difficult to use productivity-enhancing IDEs
    like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.  CodeTalk is a Visual Studio extension that was previously released 
    to help fix address this problem by providing accessibility improvements while writing and debugging source code.
    The core challenge is that these development environments have highly-complex UI that present large volumes of 
    related content that is often dynamically updated to convey state.  The source code content is structurally interrelated 
    creating significant impediments to efficient navigation.  Dynamic updates can either show continuously updated 
    application state or provide context that a user-initiated action is required.<p />

    VSCodeTalk offers a set of features that address the following categories of usage scenarios i) glanceability, ii) navigability,
    and iii) real-time alertability.  Glanceability is the ability to quickly look at a source code file and ascertain 
    information about the overall code structure.  Navigability is the ability to quickly move around the code to 
    the desired code segment.  Real-time alertability is the ability to receive notifications about the application state
    at the desired time.  The following VSCodeTalk features help improve these use-cases.<p />

    <ul>
        <li><b>Glanceability</b> Function List, Current Context</li>
        <li><b>Navigability</b> Function List, Current Context, Go to Parent</li>
        <li><b>Real-time alertability</b> TalkPoints Debugging Information, Syntax Error Information</li>
    </ul>

    Please watch the following video for additional information about VSCodeTalk, including a demo of some of the 
    most useful features.<p />

    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    The VSCodeTalk project was inspired by the CodeTalk project that is documented at 
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codetalk/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codetalk/</a>.  
    That project includes a Visual Studio extension that implements many of the ideas discussed in the accompanying research paper
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/04/CodeTalkCHI2018CameraReady.pdf">
        https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/04/CodeTalkCHI2018CameraReady.pdf</a>.<p />

    The issues people with visual impairments encounter when using software development environments
    are of interest to tools providers.  The Visual Studio Code team has embraced several concepts similar 
    to VSCodeTalk features that make the default product more accessible.  One example is the Code
    Outline feature that overlaps with the Function List or Code Summary features in many regards.
    Another example is the debugger which has built in voice notifications for several
    breakpoint events, such as speaking the words 'stopped' or 'continue.' <p />

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    VSCodeTalk project helps improve some accessibility use-cases for visually impaired users.  
    There is a Visual Studio Code extension available that can be manually installed from a VSIX extension 
    file.  The source code and binary files for this extension are available from the following links.

    <ul>
        <li>Extension VSIX <a href='https://github.com/kburtram/CodeTalk/releases/download/0.3.0/codetalk-0.3.0.vsix'>
        https://github.com/kburtram/CodeTalk/releases/download/0.3.0/codetalk-0.3.0.vsix</a></li>
        <li>Source Code https://github.com/kburtram/CodeTalk/tree/0.3.0</li>
    </ul>

    The accessibility challenges of i) glanceability, ii) navigability, and iii) real-time alertability
    have been addressed through the following VSCodeTalk features.

    <ul>
        <li><b>Function List</b> - displays a list of functions in a source file.</li>
        <li><b>Current Context</b> - displays context information about current cursor location such as 
            source code line, the function being edited, and the parent elements.</li>
        <li><b>Go to Parent</b> - moves the cursor to the parent source code element.</li>
        <li><b>Talkpoint Debug</b> Information - generates an audio alert when a breakpoint is hit.
            The alert can be configured to be a tonal, text or an expression audio sound.
            The talkpoint can be configured to either stop or continue.
        </li>
        <li><b>Syntax Error Information</b> - generates an audio alert when a new syntax error 
            is introduced into a source code file.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Validation</h2>
    The CodeTalk feature set was based on research that involved close collaboration with the BLV community.
    VSCodeTalk is largely a direct port of these features so we have some validation that the underlying 
    concepts are sound.  A significant aspect of the validation that we did was to ensure that features 
    were implemented correctly and that the user experience passed accessibility testing scenarios. <p />
    
    The accessibility testings procedures focused on screen-reader audio output and keyboard-only navigation
    scenarios.  During screen-reader validation we would go systematically through each feature with the NVDA 
    software enabled.  The spoken text would be compared with the displayed content to confirm that 
    the output is correct and that sufficient text was read to provide source code context. <p />
    
    The keyboard navigation validation scenarios were mostly focused on ensuring the cursor focus could 
    easily be moved back-and-forth between the editor and the VSCodeTalk feature view windows.  The content 
    in the views, such as the current context or the function list, has keyboard command handlers to 
    refocus back to the editor on the ENTER keypress. <p />

    <h2>Learnings and future work</h2>
    The next steps for the VSCodeTalk project is to try to merge the Visual Studio Code extension source code upstream to 
    the <a href='https://github.com/Microsoft/CodeTalk'>https://github.com/Microsoft/CodeTalk</a> repo.  We would
    then like to collaborate with the CodeTalk project maintainers to help transfer the extension source code to
    them for a potential release to the Visual Studio Marketplace. <p />

    There were many learning opportunities while implementing the VSCodeTalk project.  A major learning was from
    trying to understand the software development process for people for visual impairments.  Software development 
    tools display a large amount of information simultaneously.  And their is a lot of context that must be maintained
    about the current cursor position in order to understand what modifications are required in a source file.
    While implementing and testing the VSCodeTalk feature set we tried to mimic these user workflows.  This exercise
    was a great way to build a better understanding of some of the challenges for BLV users of software development tools. <p />
